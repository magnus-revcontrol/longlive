Bootstrapping with US Declaration of Independence, updates and edits to come...

In State Legislative Assembly, dated: _____________ 

The Declaration of the states of: California, Oregon, Washington and others which may join us, formerly of the united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the governance of their own citizenry, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are granted by their government with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. And such suffering has been afflicted upon the people, as the Constitution was laid aside by those who would usurp the rightfully unalienable rights of the people when with a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these States and such is now the necessity which constrains them to acknowledge that their former Systems of Government under the Constitution has been laid aside by despots. The history of the present President of the United States is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has assumed the position of President in violation of the United States Constitution, Amendment 14.

He has forbidden his department heads to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has impuned upon Representative Houses and individual legislators repeatedly, for opposing with proper firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has usurped powers delegated by constitution to the courts and legislature; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the States remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers, and for encouraging and partaking in the corruption of the courts of law and justice.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and enabling the corruption of their offices through acceptance of payment or remuneration by gifts beyond their salaries and encouraged the corruption of the judiciary for the benefit of a few over the law and rights of the people.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers into existing offices to harass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has made federal officers, in times of peace, into Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation and Jurispudence:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury and depriving justice by in many cases interfering with Trial by Jury and the granting of Pardons to enemies of the people who have assaulted this nation, it's people and it's Constitution:

For punishing properly elected officials to be tried for pretended offenses:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For superceding our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has Governance here by violation of the US Constitution, by declaring us out of his Protection and by waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our lands merciless and contrived treatment, seizing, holding captive and causing their deportation.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A pretending Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our brethren and elected officials. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature members to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the States of California, Oregon, Washington and others which may join us, formerly of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled,  do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these States, solemnly publish and declare, That these states united are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the Unconstitutional Trump Presidency, and that all political connection between them and the unconstitutional Trump Administration and it's puppets in the Judicial and Legislative organizations, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor, and to join as a reconstituted confederation of of free states holding as interim Constitution the United States Constitution and it's Twenty Eight Amendments as they stood before the Usurpation of power on Jan 20th 2025.

The said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their Liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.

The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union, the free inhabitants of each of these states, fugitives from Justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunity's of free citizens in the several states; and the people of each state shall have free ingress and regress to and from any other state, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the same duties, impositions and restrictions as the inhabitants thereof respectively, provided that such restrictions shall not extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported into any state, to any other State of which the Owner is an inhabitant; provided also that no imposition, duties or restriction shall be laid by any state, on the property of these states, or the coalition of them nor the coalition lay impositions on the property, trade, or rights of them except as regulated under the constitution and legislated by the representative houses.
