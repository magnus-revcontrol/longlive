    <p>Project Magnus Opus</p>

<p>The encouraging the citizens of the State of Washington (and all others) to agree to a Declaration of Independence from the usurped and unconstitutional Trump Presidency, the joining into a new nation with constitution being the US Constitution and Amendments thereto existing prior to Trump’s inauguration and to propose a Constitution to be adopted upon ratification.</p>

<p>The reasons given including that Trumps inauguration was unconstitutional, and that he has used undo  and illegal influence to corrupt both the Judicial and Legislative branches of the US Government leading to the fall of the rule of law under the conditions of the US Constitution.</p>

<p>Proper action by the US government would have been the immediate impeachment and removal of Mr Trump from office, and as his entire second presidency is in violation of the constitution the voiding of all Trump executive orders, nominations, appointments, terminations, etc.</p>

<p>That this is not likely to occur under current circumstances necessitates the secession of states from the US in an effort to induce the existing US Legislature to take right and proper action, and to return to the citizens those freedoms and that rule of law rightfully guaranteed under the Constitution.</p>

<p>The mission of this would be rendered non requisite and the project will be considered successfully completed if:
A)
	1. The US Legislature impeaches Trump, and removes him from the office of the Presidency.
	2. The Trump second presidency is ruled unconstitutional and all actions taken since inauguration rolled back, including the termination and hiring of all positions at any level, the striking of all Executive Orders since Trump’s second inauguration.
	3. The resignation of all Trump federal and Supreme Court nominees.</p>

<p>-or-</p>

<p>B)
	1. The succession of states from the former US via declaration by state legislatures
	2. The adoption of return to the Constitution as the law of the land.
	3. The ratification of a new Constitution under a new federal government
	4. The successful formation of a new federal government.</p>

<p>Process:
A) preparation of:
	1. Declaration of Independence of the Cascadian States based largely on US Declaration of Independence 1777.
	2. Proposed Constitution based upon US Constitution and amendments, and other such documents (Mexican and Canadian Constitutions, Iroquois League, etc)
	3. draft motions for each required legislative vote or governor’s order
B) proposal for Cascadian Congress to be called to 
	1. approve declaration of independence
	2. motions to state legislatures
	3. proposals for other states to join
C) States send– 
	Declaration to:
	1. office of President
	2. Vice President
	3. all members of US House and Senate.
	Declaration and include proposals for other states to join to:
	1. All US state governors
	2. all state houses of legislature
	3. All similar governing entities of US territories
	4. All first nations governments in US
	Declaration and request to report for orders to:
	1. all military commanders based in states to report to Governors in said state.
	Declaration and request for acknowledgment and ambassador exchange:
	1. NATO
	2. Canada
	3. Mexico
	4. Japan
	5. Britain
	6. France
	7. Germany
	8. Israel
	9. Russia
	10. Ukraine
	 All other foreign governments.</p>

<p>D) State Legislatures vote on joining together as new  Union with initial Constitution to be US Constitution and Amendments prior to Trump Inauguration take two, with proposed consolidated Constitution upon ratification.</p>

<p>E) Continue lobbying for other states to join.</p>

<p>F) upon substantial states joining…
	1. Rename to United States of America
	2. demand Trump government cease and desist from use of name United States of America, and relinquish all assets of such to the reformed federal government.</p>
